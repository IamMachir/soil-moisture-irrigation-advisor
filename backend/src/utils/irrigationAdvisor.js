/**
 * Decide whether a zone needs watering, and log an irrigation event if so.
 * Each zone can have its own configurable moisture_threshold (e.g. thirstier
 * plants might want a higher threshold), rather than one global setting.
 * This is the rule-based "advisor" — simple, explainable logic rather than
 * ML, which is appropriate for a low-cost campus-scale system.
 *
 * A cooldown window prevents re-triggering on every reading while a zone
 * sits below threshold: once watering fires, it won't fire again for the
 * same zone until COOLDOWN_MINUTES has passed, even if subsequent readings
 * are still below threshold. This mirrors how a real pump/relay and
 * absorption-into-soil delay work, and is also the signal firmware should
 * use to decide whether to physically pulse a relay right now.
