/**
 * Simulated sensor pipeline.
 *
 * Stands in for real soil moisture sensors (see HARDWARE.md for the
 * physical build: an LM393-based resistive/capacitive probe on an ESP32)
 * until hardware is wired up. This simulates the actual measurement chain a
 * real sensor goes through, not just an abstract percentage:
 *
 *   raw ADC drift (physics) -> sensor noise -> calibration mapping to % ->
 *   POST to backend -> backend's advisor decides watered: true/false ->
 *   simulator applies the physical EFFECT of that decision (moisture rises
 *   only if the advisor actually said to water this zone).
 *
 * This last point matters: earlier versions of this simulator had the
 * simulated soil "water itself" whenever it crossed a hardcoded 30%
 * threshold, regardless of what the advisor (with its real, configurable
 * per-zone threshold and cooldown) actually decided. That meant the
 * simulated physical world and the decision-making logic could disagree —
 * e.g. a zone configured with a 50% threshold would get an advisor
 * "watered: true" at 45%, but the simulator wouldn't apply any physical
 * watering effect until its own unrelated 30% cutoff. Driving the moisture
 * bump off the actual API response closes that gap, and is also exactly
 * what real firmware will do (see HARDWARE.md's firmware reference).
 *
 * Drying isn't uniform: each zone has its own drying-rate multiplier (e.g.
 * a sunnier plot dries faster than a shaded one), and drying speeds up
 * during simulated "daytime" hours to mimic real evaporation patterns.
 *
 * Once real sensors exist, this file can be swapped for firmware that
 * performs the same measurement -> POST flow — the backend API contract
 * (POST /api/readings -> { moisturePercent }) does not need to change.
