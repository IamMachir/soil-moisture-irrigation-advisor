/**
 * Sensor calibration constants and the raw-ADC-to-percentage mapping.
 *
 * Real resistive/capacitive soil moisture sensors (see HARDWARE.md) output
 * a raw analog value, not a moisture percentage directly. Per the sensor
 * behavior documented in HARDWARE.md: raw value INCREASES as soil dries
 * (dry soil = higher resistance = higher voltage at the ADC pin for these
 * modules), which is why a raw value ABOVE a "dry" threshold means "too dry"
 * in the reference Arduino sketch this project is modeled on.
 *
 * Every physical sensor unit reads slightly differently even for the same
 * soil moisture level (manufacturing variance, wiring, probe corrosion over
 * time), which is why calibration is per-device, not a fixed constant —
 * see HARDWARE.md's calibration procedure. This module's DEFAULT_CALIBRATION
 * stands in for values you'd get by actually calibrating a real sensor
 * (submerge in water for the wet point, let dry completely in air for the
 * dry point).
 *
 * ADC_MAX defaults to 4095 (ESP32's 12-bit ADC, the recommended
 * microcontroller since it has built-in WiFi). If using an Arduino Uno's
 * 10-bit ADC via a serial bridge instead (see HARDWARE.md's budget path),
 * ADC_MAX should be 1023 and calibration values re-taken at that
 * resolution — the two are not interchangeable.
